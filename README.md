In conclusion, we implemented and evaluated four different machine learning models for classification: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). 
For the SVM model, we utilized the SVC class from scikit-learn library and achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. The classification report provided insights into precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
Similarly, the Logistic Regression model, implemented using the LogisticRegression class, yielded an accuracy of XX% on the test set. The classification report revealed the performance metrics for each class, assisting in understanding the model's effectiveness.
The Decision Trees classifier, implemented with the DecisionTreeClassifier class, achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. The classification report provided a detailed breakdown of precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
Lastly, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, constructed with the KNeighborsClassifier class, obtained an accuracy of XX% on the test set. The classification report allowed us to evaluate the precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class, providing a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.
To validate the models further, we conducted testing against manual data. The predictions for the species were generated for the provided input vectors using the trained models. These predictions can be utilized to make informed decisions or classifications based on the model's learned patterns.
Overall, this analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the performance of each model and their predictions on both the test set and manual data. The evaluation metrics and testing against manual data enable us to assess the models' capabilities and make informed decisions based on the desired classification tasks.
